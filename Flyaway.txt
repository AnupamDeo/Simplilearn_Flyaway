Sure, I'd be happy to help you design and develop an airline booking portal named FlyAway. Here are the general steps I would take to create the application:



1.Create a GitHub repository to manage the project artifacts. This will allow you to track changes to the code and collaborate with other developers.

2.Use a Java web framework such as Spring Boot to create the backend of the application. This will handle the routing and processing of requests, as well as interacting with the database.

3.Create a search form on the homepage that allows users to enter their travel details, such as the date of travel, source, destination, and the number of persons. Use JavaScript and HTML/CSS to build this form.

4.Use the information entered in the search form to query the database and retrieve a list of available flights with their ticket prices. Return this information to the frontend and display it to the user.

5.Create a registration page where users can enter their personal details. Use this information to create a new booking in the database.

6.Create a payment gateway (could be a dummy payment gateway) to handle the payment process. Once the payment is complete, return a confirmation page with the details of the booking.

7.Create an admin backend for the application. This will include an admin login page, a master list of places for source and destination, a master list of airlines, and a list of flights where each flight has a source, destination, airline, and ticket price.

8.Use a Java ORM like Hibernate to interact with the database and perform CRUD operation.

9.Test the application thoroughly and fix any bugs that are found.

10.Deploy the application to a web server or hosting service.
